Well, I think it's better to explain why I launch this blog in Github Pages.

In the next month, I am moving to another business unit, from the traditional Datacenter solutions to [Huawei Cloud](https://www.huaweicloud.com), in order to get used to the new position, I need to learning something new for me and I am planing to be a full stack solution architectures. 

**Not just focus on the infrastructures, but also learn more about Applications, Big Data and AI, etc.**

Now I have several projects about the tranditional Datacenter solutions, for example: Storage, Server, Virtualization, etc. So I need improving the knowledge about network in Datacenter, various vertical industries.

During this process, I will try to share and record what I learn.

That's the main motivation for me to setup my personal blog here.

First I will try to move my previous posts here, at the same time, I will make summary about what I am learning.

### Blog Purpose: ###

* First, I want to recoard the life here, and hope these experiences can help someone needs them.
* Second, Someone has similar experiences can give more feedback about these posts. 


That's all.
