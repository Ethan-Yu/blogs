Well, I think it's better to explain why I launch this blog in Github Pages.

I am moving to another job area now, from the traditional Datacenter solutions to the public area, and want to be a full stack solution architectures, not just the infrastructures or cloud infrastructures, but also to be a solution architecutures about big data, AI.

In order to reach that position, I have experiences about server, storage, virtualization, and I need to know more about network in Datacenter, in the future I also need to know more about the big data and AI.

During this process, I will try to remark and share what I learn.

So I really need one personal blog to show these, I will try to move the previous posts here, at the same time, I will make summary about what I am learning.

###My Blog Purpose:###

1. First, I hope these experiences can help someone needs them.
2. Second, I will share my summary about the knowledge, maybe someone can give me better suggestions.
3. Third, I really need the records about life and job.


That's all. Loving Cat.
