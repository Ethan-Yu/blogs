Well, I think it's better to start the first blog to explain the reason I launch this blog in Github Pages.

In the next month, I am moving to another business unit, from the traditional Datacenter solutions to [Huawei Cloud](https://www.huaweicloud.com). 

In order to face the challenges in the new position, and I wish I could be a solution architectures. Now I will make a summary about the work experiences during the past several years, and also remark some interesting technology here. 

**Not just focus on the infrastructures, but also learn more about Applications and Business.**

During the past 4 years, I have several projects about the tranditional Datacenter solutions, for example: Storage, Server, Virtualization, etc.

Now I need to know more about network, security, Cloud, etc.  During this process, I will try to share and record what I learn.

That's the main motivation for me to setup my personal blog here.

First I will try to move my previous posts here, at the same time, I will make summary about what I am learning.

### Blog Purpose: ###

* First, I want to record the life here, and hope these experiences can help someone needs them.
* Second, Someone has similar experiences can give some useful suggestions.


That's all.
